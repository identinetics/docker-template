# Docker Build Number Generation

## Quickstart

Running build.sh will automatically set buildnumbers in ./manifest and docker image tags.
Before you build you need to prepare:

1. Edit conf.sh and set MANIFEST_SCOPE to 'global' or 'local'.
   'global' is for develpoment environments with write access to the repo, 'local' for the target environments.
2. Copy /template/manifest2.sh to install/opt/bin in your Docker environment,
   and edit it include all files that should increase the build number when changed.
3. Add following lines to Dockerfile:

    RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.config/pip \
     && printf "[global]\ndisable-pip-version-check = True\n" > $HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf
    COPY install/opt/bin/manifest2.sh /opt/bin/manifest2.sh
4. Make sure that python3 is in the path of the default user in the docker image
5. If you need to push the image after the build, do this with the -P option of build.sh, e.g. in a Jenkinspipeline

## Use Case

To deliver a docker image the project is contained in a git repository with the dscripts submodule and with optional submodules.

Images for the target environment are being built in a target (qa or production) environment,
which is only informed by the git repository and its build scripts (dscripts/build.sh, Jenkinsfile, .travis, ..).

Docker images shall be tagged with build numbers.
The build number is dependent on both source repositories and dependent artifacts.
The build number shall be incremented if and only if both or either one change.

## Design

To support this process the dscripts submodule includes an option to automatically generate build numbers across a 2-stage environment.
Build numbers have the format S.T, where S is the build number in the source (development) environment,
 and T is the subordinate build number in the target environment,
 reflecting changed dependencies (and possibly local patches).

Therefore, running a build in the target environment will increment the second part T when dependencies have changed,
 even when the source repos are identical. For example:

* The source repo is pushed to github with the build number 123.0
* The subsequent build in the target environment will produce build with the same number (123.0).
  (This is assuming that the dependencies are identical, otherwise the T-part in the number would be incremented.)
* 6 weeks later the regular update build in the target environment will hit a changed dependent package.
  Therefore the build number will increment to 123.1. The new manifest will be stored locally.
* 2 months later the regular update build in the target environment will hit a changed upstream docker image.
  Therefore the build number will increase to 123.2.
  Of course, the local manifest history must not be deleted.
* The most recent build is always tagged as :latest to reference to the same image in Dockerfile and manifest.

## Implementation

The general flow is:

* Docker build generates an initial build manifest in the dev environment.
 This manifest comprises 2 parts:
  ** Docker environment artifacts, such as source repositories and upstream image id
  ** Image dependencies, collected by /opt/bin/manifest.sh executed after docker build
* The first manifest is stored as manifest.global/1.0
* Further builds increase the build number if the manifest is different from the most recent version:
 ** In the source environment (i.e., an environment with write access to the repo) each new manifest will be added to the manifest/global directory with the new build number (2.0, 3.0, ..)
 ** In the target environment each new manifest will be added to the manifest/local directory with the new subordinate build number (2.1, 3.1, 3.2, ..)
 ** Each image will be tagged with 'B' + build number.

### Manifest contents

The manifest is a list of key value pairs separated by '=='.
The key is the component identifier structured as group and component path or name.
The value is either a hash shortened to 12 characters or a package version number.
For better legibility hashes are prepended with a '#'.

The component identifier is a human readable string grouping and addressing components for the build process.
It has the form group-id::path.

Following group-ids havbe been defined so far:
FILE::<path>
FROM::<base image>
PYTHON[.venv]::[package]
REPO::git-repo-path

The repo path will likely be different in source and target environments,
like git@github.com:owner/project and https://github.com/owner/project.
Therefore only the owner/project must be used in the manifest key.
An optional branch can be added, such as in owner/project/qa.


Example manifest:

FROM::centos:centos7==#ff426288ea90
FILE::/etc/pki/tls/certpem==#168b6dce45ed
FILE::/opt/app/lib/xyz.jar==#57f5227ea8ae
PYTHON::six==1.11.0
PYTHON::urllib3==1.22
REPO::identinetics/dscripts==#cb85cc37c
REPO::owner/project==#cf0080d07


### Manifest generation

The manifest is generated from both the docker build environment
 and by instantiaing a container from the generated image and inspecting the component versions.

dscripts/build.sh will automatically generate manifest files und less invoked with -M.
To generate a manifest the project need to contain script "manifest.sh" in the project root.

The entry "MANIFEST_SCOPE" controls whether manifests are written to manifest/global/ or manifest/local/.
